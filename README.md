# AppRegistry is obsolete
The *AppRegistry* feature of Quay and the `appr` CLI client are obsolete and are no longer maintained. The code for the *AppRegistry* feature has also been removed from the Quay registry code base. The service has been removed from quay.io, see more details in this [blog post](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/moving-on-from-applications-and-legacy-signing-on-quay.io).

Please consider switching OCI artifacts for storaging Helm charts on Quay and quay.io. Read more about here: https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/quay-oci-artifact-support-for-helm-charts
